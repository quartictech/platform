# Documentation

This is based on [Zurb Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/), originally created via:

```
npm install -g foundation-cli
foundation new --framework sites --template zurb
```

We then swapped out Panini with Jekyll to handle Markdown nicely.  Note that this means Jekyll is **not** managing
asset files.
